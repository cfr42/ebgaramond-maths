# Package

This package provides some LaTeX support for the use of EBGaramond in
mathematics.  It is based on, and requires, ebgaramond. It was created in
response to a question at http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/152038/ and tested in
the form of an answer at http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/152347/. It is
published as a package at the request of the question author in the hope that
it may be useful but scarcely the expectation.

**Note the package WILL break when ebgaramond introduces incompatible changes.
Please report issues on Codeberg as explained below.**

**Note that some documentation and test files are automatically generated by
l3build/fontscripts from templates.** This means there is no specific source for
some PDFs and normalised logs, even though all code required to generate them 
is included in this package together with fontscripts. Information about this 
system may be found in the fontscripts documentation. 

## Changes

Version 1.2 is updated to use the 2019-05-04 version of ebgaramond.

Version 1.3 is updated to use the 2024-04-23 version of ebgaramond which uses
the 2017 version 1.001 of EBGaramond12 by Georg Duffner and Octavio Pardo.

## Consequences

To the best of the author's knowledge, no hedgehogs were harmed in the
production of this package.
