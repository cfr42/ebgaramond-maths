# Package

This package provides some LaTeX support for the use of EBGaramond in
mathematics.  It is based on, and requires, ebgaramond. It was created in
response to a question at http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/152038/ and tested in
the form of an answer at http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/152347/. It is
published as a package at the request of the question author in the hope that
it may be useful but scarcely the expectation.

**Note the package WILL break when ebgaramond introduces incompatible changes.
Please report issues on Codeberg as explained below.**

## Changes

Version 1.2 is updated to use the 2019-05-04 version of ebgaramond.

Version 1.3 is updated to use the version of ebgaramond.

## Consequences

To the best of the author's knowledge, no hedgehogs were harmed in the
production of this package.

## Code Repositories

Code for the LaTeX support package is hosted at 
	https://codeberg.org/cfr/ebgaramond-maths
For convenience, the repository is mirrored at
